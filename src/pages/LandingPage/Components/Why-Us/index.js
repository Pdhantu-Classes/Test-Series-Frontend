            “The Pdhantu” is an initiative to reach every corner of India providing education via online as well as offline. The main motive is to connect every individual who wants to learn, achieve or have a dream to reach a goal. We are here to provide education at a very nominal cost so that every individual of the society can get benefits from it. Our theme of work is “Invest Time not Money” which truly shows that our target is only those who want to learn or achieve but some hurdles stop them to get it so we named as “The Pdhantu”.
